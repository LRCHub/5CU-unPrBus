I wanna live my life like thunder
Don't wanna live my life like numbers
Wonderin' why tonight
Breakin' on through to find my light
I wanna live my life like thunder
Don't wanna live my life like numbers
Wonderin' why and how
I'm gonna fly so high and never hit the ground

I feel like I'm always tight
My brain is in chains
While walkin' this lane
I can calculate my future
I need to break away
I need to find a different day

I wanna live my life like thunder
Don't wanna live my life like numbers
Wonderin' why tonight
Breakin' on through to find my light
I wanna live my life like thunder
Don't wanna live my life like numbers
Wonderin' why and how
I'm gonna fly so high and never hit the ground

I can't stand to live in a box
No wind on my face
No reason to race
I can't stand the social routine
I wanna go above
I wanna reach above those clouds

I wanna live my life like thunder
Don't wanna live my life like numbers
Wonderin' why tonight
Breakin' on through to find my light
I wanna live my life like thunder
Don't wanna live my life like numbers
Wonderin' why tonight
Breakin' on through to find my light
I wanna live my life like thunder
Don't wanna live my life like numbers
Wonderin' why and how
I'm gonna fly so high and never hit the ground
