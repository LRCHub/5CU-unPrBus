[Refrain]
Got that uh-huh, that uh-huh
Big, big uh-huh, uh-huh
That uh-huh, uh-huh
Big, big uh-huh, yeah
[Verse 1]
Something a little like thunder
Got that make you wonder
"How did she become her?"
Yeah, you can't fit it into just one word
Boom, boom, shake the ground
Better make room 'cause I'm coming now (Yeah)
Careful how you move though
Might meet my alter ego
Boom, boom, underground
Better make way 'cause I'm coming now
[Chorus]
Make way, make way, make way
Taking space up in the sky
I got that boom, boom so high
When I step in, you gon' see why
I'll take my place up ahead
No, you said I'll never get by
Now look at mе, I'm so high
You wanna know what it feels like
It's like
[Refrain]
Got that uh-huh, that uh-huh
Big, big uh-huh, uh-huh
That uh-huh, uh-huh
Big, big uh-huh, yeah
[Verse 2]
Try mе a little bit, baby, it's gonna drive ya
crazy
My energy, everything, cannot contain it
You can't put me in a box, you can't teach me
how to stop
I'ma collar poppin' pocket rocket, see me at the
top
Baby, um, I'm a star
Let me show you how it's done, like, ta-da
No, they do not come any realer, don't come any
bigger
Eight figure in my bag with a figure, eight
figure
Like, mm, this is who we are, mm, can't break it
apart
[Chorus]
Make way, make way, make way
Taking space up in the sky
I got that boom, boom so high
When I step in you gon' see why
I'll take my place up ahead
No, you said I'll never get by
Now look at me, I'm so high
You wanna know what it feels like
It's like
[Refrain]
Got that uh-huh, that uh-huh
Big, big uh-huh, uh-huh
That uh-huh, uh-huh
Big, big uh-huh, yeah
Got that uh-huh, that uh-huh
Big, big uh-huh, uh-huh
That uh-huh, uh-huh
Big, big uh-huh, yeah
